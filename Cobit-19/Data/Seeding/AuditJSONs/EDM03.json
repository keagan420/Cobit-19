Senior management sets direction and demonstrates visible and genuine support for risk practices. Additionally, management must clearly define risk appetite and ensure an appropriate level of debate as part of business-asusual activities. Desirable behaviors include encouraging employees to raise issues or negative outcomes and show transparency with regard to I&T risk. Business owners should accept ownership of I&T risk when applicable and demonstrate genuine commitment to I&T risk management by providing adequate resource levels.",
